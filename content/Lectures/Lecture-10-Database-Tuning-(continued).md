# More Tuning

## Index Tuning

Topics
- Types of queries
- Index structure
- Clustered vs. non clustered indexes
- Covering/composite indexes
- Indexes on small tables
- Recommendations

### Types of Queries

1. Point Query
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE ssnum = 8478:
```

2. Multipoint Query (Index tuning is especially usefull to reduce disk accesses on non clusteres indexes)
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE dept = 'Information Systems';
```
3. Range Query
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE salary >= 40000
	AND salary < 60000;
```
4. Prefix Match Query
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE name LIKE 'Ke%';
```
5. Extremal Query (in a B+ Tree you would only need to follow the rightmost path)
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```
6. Ordering Query
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary;
```
7. Grouping Query (using HASH if no index is available)
```sql
SELECT dept, AVG(salary)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY dept;
```
8. Join Query (Prevent nested loops)
```sql
SELECT e1.ssnum
FROM Employee e1, Employee e2
WHERE e1.manager = e2.ssnum
	AND e1.salary > e2.salary;
```

### Index Structure
![](assets/index_struct.png)
#### B+ -Tree 
- Always start from root (Good general purpose index structure)
	- Useful for range queries and extremal queries, where hash indexes are not
	- SQL Server mostly uses this
- Minimize height by having more children per node
	- Length of search key influences ***fanout*** (number of children per node)
	- Choose a small key when creating an index
	- If the key is large, it may be possible to use key compression
		- store only part of the key to distinguish between neighbors
		- e.g. store ' Smi ', Smo ', Smy ' instead of 'Smith', 'Smoot', '
- Log search
#### Hash
- Straight to row
	- Faster than B+ -trees for **point** queries and **multipoint** queries
- UNLESS overflow buckets
	- Must be reorganized if there is a significant amount of overflow
- Size of hash structure is not related to length of search key
	- hash function is applied on key to locate bucket with pointers

### Clustered vs. non-clustered indexes
Clustered index
- Co-locates records whose values are near to one another
	- For B+-trees, two values are near if they are close in sort order
		- Good for point, multipoint, partial match, general join queries
	- For hash indexes, two values are near only if they are identical
		- Good for point, multipoint, equijoin queries
- Non-clustered index
	- A non-clustered index is independent of the table organization
	- There may be several non-clustered indexes per table

![](assets/clustvsnonclus.png)
Clustered indexes can be dense or sparse
- **Dense index**
	- pointers are associated to records; one index entry per record
- **Sparse index**
	- pointers are associated to pages; one index entry per page
	- any values ùë£1‚â§ùë£<ùë£2can be found on the same page as ùë£1
- **Non clustered indexes must be dense**
	- cannot be sparse, since values ùë£1‚â§ùë£<ùë£2can be anywhere

#### Benefits of a Clustered Index
- A sparse clustered index stores fewer pointers than a dense index (Less height in B+-Tree)
- A clustered index is good for multipoint queries
- A clustered index can improve equality joins

##### Evaluation of Clustered Indexes with Insertions
- Insertions cause page splits and extra I/O for each query
- **Maintenance** consists in rebuilding or reorganizing the index
	- With maintenance, performance is constant
	- Without maintenance, performance degrades

##### Redundant Tables
- There can be only one clustered index per table
- **Question**: Wouldn't it be nice to have multiple clustered indexes?
- **Answer**: 
	- Replicate table to use a clustered index on a different attribute
	- Works well only if low insertion/update rate

#### Benefits of Non-clustered Indexes
A non-clustered index is good if the query retrieves few records compared to the number of pages in the table
- Always useful for point queries
- Useful for multipoint queries if table contains many distinct values
- In an experiment was observed that an index is good if query selectivity < 15% of records
At some point, a table scan becomes better than using a non-clusters index

##### Covering
A non-clustered index can eliminate the need to access the underlying table through **covering**
- Example:
- with a **composite index** on ( A , B , C ) or
- with a **covering index** on A that includes B and C
- the query below can be answered based on the index alone
```sql
SELECT B , C
FROM R
WHERE A = 5;
```
- It might be worth creating multiple indexes to increase the likelihood that the optimizer finds a covering index
```
Simply put, the covering index contains the data to be searched through include, so that the SQL query can get the required data without reaching the basic table. The composite index is to create an index on the combination of multiple columns, these columns may contain all the columns of the query, or may not contain.
```

### Covering/composite indexes
A non-clustered index can eliminate the need to access the underlying table through covering or composite index
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE dept = 'Information Systems';
```
- A good covering index would be on ( dept , name )
- Index on ( name , dept ) would be useless

Drawbacks
- Tends to have a large size
- Update to an attribute causes index to be modified

#### Composite Search Keys
To retrieve records with **age =30 AND salary =4000**
-  Index on ( age , salary ) is better than index on age or index on salary
-  Index could be clustered or non-clustered
If condition is 20< age <30 AND salary <5000
- Clustered index on ( age , salary ) or salary, age ) is best
If condition is age =30 AND salary <5000
- Clustered index on ( age , salary ) is better than salary, age

### Indexes on small tables

- Indexes reduce the scope of locks
- Indexes might not be justified when thinking on queries, but on updates or concurrent transation it might bring isolation to those transactions

### Notes
- Use a hash index for equality queries
- Use a B+ tree if equality and non equality queries may be used
- Use clustered indexes if:
	- queries need all (or most) fields in records,
	- records are too large for a composite index,
	- and multiple records are returned per query
- If possible, use a covering index for critical queries
- Do not use index if the time lost inserting and updating overwhelms time saved when querying
### Optimizing workloads
- Modern database systems: **automated tuning wizards**
- Provide a workload as input
- Two step approach
	- best index
	- best subset of index
- Consider both the benefits and the overhead


## Lock and log tuning
### Log tuning
![](assets/stable_store_data_log.png)
- The data disk and log disk should be separate

**Topics**
- Put the log on a separate disk
- Delay output to database disks
- Database dumps and checkpoints
- From batch to minibatch transactions

**Tuning the recovery system**

### Lock tuning

#### Trade-off between correctness and performance
- Concurrency Control Goals
- Correctness goals
- Serializability: each transaction appears to execute in isolation
- Performance goals
	- Reduce blocking
		- One transaction waits for another to release its locks
	- Avoid deadlocks
		- Transactions are waiting for each other to release their locks

#### Ideal Transaction
- Acquires few locks and favors S locks over X locks
- Acquires locks with fine granularity
- Holds locks for a short time

#### Eliminate unnecessary locking
Locking is not necessary when:
- Only one transaction runs at a time
	- e.g. when loading the database
- All transactions are read only
	- e.g. decision support queries on archival database

***PROJECT RELEVANT***
Use available options to **suppress locking**
- Choose the appropriate isolation level
- Disable ***lock escalation*** (FEW LOCKS GENERATE FULL LOCK OF HIGHER OBJECT)
	- when many row or page locks are converted to a table lock
- Use table hints such as **WITH (NOLOCK)**

#### Sacrificing Isolation for Performance

![](assets/corrvsavail.png)

#### Transaction Chopping

- Rule of thumb
	-  Suppose **T** accesses data **X** and **Y** , but other transactions access **X** or **Y** and nothing else
	- Then **T** can be divided into two transactions, one accessing **X** and another accessing **Y**
- Caution
- Adding a new transaction to a set of existing transactions may invalidate previous choppings

![](assets/transac_chop.png)

**Trade-off**
The consistency of X+Y IS NOT GUARANTEED (create money or make money disappear)
BUT X>=0

##### Why
- **Long transactions**
	- accessing almost all pages of a table
	- should use table locks mostly to avoid deadlocks
- **Short transactions**
	- accessing only a few records of a table
	- should use record locks to enhance concurrency

#### Hot Spots
- Data item accessed by many transactions and updated by some
- e.g. max id in a table to insert a value
- Each update transaction must complete before other transactions can obtain a lock on the item (bottleneck)
- **Techniques to circumvent**:
	- Access the item as late as possible in the transaction, to minimize the time that the transaction holds the lock on item
	- Use special database management facilities; e.g. use auto increment for sequential **key generation**, instead of counter

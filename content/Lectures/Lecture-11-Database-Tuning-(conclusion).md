# MORE TUNING
## Hardware and OS tuning 

### Threads
Giving higher/lower priority to some transactions can backfire  
- may cause ***priority inversion***  
-  example  
	- T1 (higher priority) waiting for lock from T3 (lower priority)  
	- T2 keeps running while T3 (and therefore T1) keep waiting

![](assets/thread_prio.png)

- "Best practice" all threads ahev the same priority

- Some systems use ***priority inheritance***  
	- When T1 requests lock on X, the priority of T3 is increased to that of T1  
	- If priority inheritance is unavailable, give same priority to all threads  
- In SQL Server, there was ***priority boosting***  
	- Giving more priority to the database system than to the OS  
	- Did not work out as expected, has been discontinued

### Database Buffer
- Ideally, store as much as possible in RAM to avoid disk accesses  
- Goal of **memory tuning**  
	- Frequently read pages should rarely require disk accesses  
- Logical vs. physical reads  
	- Logical reads: pages that need to be accessed  
	- Physical reads: pages that need to be retrieved from disk  
- Logical vs. physical writes  
	- Logical writes: changes to pages in the buffer (dirty pages)  
	- Physical writes: dirty pages are written to disk  
- Page replacements  
	- Dirty pages are written to disk to free buffer space  
	- New pages are read from disk into the free buffer space

>*Goal is Logical Reads without physical action*

Assuming OS paging and page replacements are low

![](assets/hit_RATIO.png)

- Aim for hit ratio > **90%**  
- Run typical workload and check hit ratio  
- Increase buffer size until hit ratio flattens out

Experiment with full table scan  
- If buffer size is small, table must be read entirely from disk  
	- LRU replacement strategy keeps evicting pages from memory  
- If buffer size is large, the entire table fits in memory  
	- Query is processed entirely from RAM

![](assets/buffer_size.png)

Suddenly the WHOLE TABLE can fit in memory. Beyond this point, you dont need more buffer size (for this query)


### Filesystem

Size of disk chunks allocated at one time  
- Some file systems call these **extents**  
	- In SQL Server, an extent is 8 physically **contiguous pages**  (sequential data. A single seek can read them)
- Allocate large extents to files that need to be scanned often  
- Sequential files such as *log* or *history* also benefit form **large** extents

**Usage factor** of disk pages
- Some pages are full, others are not (bad)
	- **High usage factor** (90% or higher) is good for table **scans** / *reads*
	- **Low usage factor** (70% or less) is good for frequent **insertions** / *writes*
- In SQL Server, there is also an ***index fill factor***  
	- percentage of space on each leaf-level page to be filled with data  
- Q: What can we do?
- A: **Index Maintenance**; we often rebuild indexes to reduce their internal fragmentation

Experiment with full table scan  
- Cold buffer (empty memory) to read entire table from disk  
- Throughput improves by about 10% when **usage factor** is increased from **70%** to **100%**

![](assets/usage_FACTOR.png)

Pre-fetching pages from disk  
- Speed up table/index scans by reading ahead more pages from disk  
- Experiment with full table scan  
	- Throughput improves by about 10% when the prefetching size is increased from 32 KB to 128 KB

![](assets/prefetch.png)

### RAID Levels

- RAID level 0  
	- Block striping (round robin block selection), non-redundant (data is lost)  
- RAID level 1  
	- Mirrored disks with block striping*  
- RAID level 5  
	- Block-interleaved distributed parity
([see](Lectures/Lecture-2-Storage-and-file-organization#raid---redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks))

#### Database log  
- RAID 1 is appropriate for log file(s)  
	- Mirroring provides fault tolerance with high write throughput  
	- Writes are synchronous and sequential; no benefit from striping  
	- We dont want to waste time in checksums (need fast access)
#### Temporary Files  
- RAID 0 is appropriate for temporary tables or sorting files  
	- No fault tolerance, high throughput; system can tolerate data loss 
	- when data doesnt fit in memory we need "temporary runs" (temp files) to store some memory (like in sorts or intermediate values)
#### Data and index files  
- RAID 5 provides fault tolerance and is best suited for read intensive apps

- Read performance  
	- RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5 improve read performance with multiple disks  
- Write performance  
	- Negative impact of RAID 5 for computing and writing parity block (hidden by **controller cache** (disks internal cache))

![](assets/raidss-1.png)


### Controller Cache

Disk controllers have memory that servers as cache  
- On read operations, the cache can be used for **read-ahead**
- On write operations, the cache can be used for **write-back**

Experiments with write-back mode  
- Cache friendly: the data volume is slightly larger than cache  
- Cache unfriendly: the data volume is 10x larger than cache  
	- when cache is full, requests are serialized and waiting time increases  
	- depends on disk access time and on length of waiting queue
The disk will tell us that its written when in disk controller

![](assets/disck_contr.png)

### Hardware Configuration

- **Add memory**  
	- Allows increase in buffer size  
	- Reduces load on disks  
	- Increases the hit ratio  
	- Reduces page replacement and OS paging

- Add disks  
	- Put the **log on a separate disk** to ensure that writes are sequential  (most important)
	- Use a different **RAID level** to achieve better write performance  
		- e.g. switch from RAID 5 to RAID 1 for write-intensive apps  
	- **Partition large tables** across several disks  
		- Write-intensive apps should have non-clustered indexes to separate disk, because each modification updates those indexes  
	- Read-intensive apps should partition tables across multiple disks to balance the read load (can be achieved just by using RAID)

- **Add processors**  
	- Off-load non-database tasks to other processors  
	- Provide computing power for data mining apps on copy of database  
	- Connect many independent systems together by a high-speed network  
		- Different options for sharing resources (memory, disks, processors)

- Shared-everything, shared-disks, or shared-nothing environment




## Database monitoring / troubleshooting

![](assets/monit.png)


![](assets/consu.png)

### Producer-consumer hierarchy  
- High-level consumers  
	- Users or applications issuing SQL queries or database commands  
- Intermediate consumers/resources  
	- Database subsystems that interact with each another those requests  
- Primary resources  
	- Raw resources of the machine being managed by the OS

### Performance Problems

![](assets/perfp1.png)

- Better eg. for intermediate resources problem. We have a certain DB configuration that exhaustes a certain resource (**lock escalation**)
![](assets/perfp2.png)


- Better eg. for Primary resources problem. All our queries result in physical reads
![](assets/perfp3.png)


### Systematic Approach: Three Questions

#### 1. Are critical queries being served in the most efficient manner?  
- High-level consumer question  
#### 2. Are database subsystems making optimal use of resources?  
- Intermediate consumer/resource question  
#### 3. Are there enough primary resources for the expected workload?  
- Primary resources question

#### Critical Query Monitoring

![](q1.png)

#### Routine Monitoring

![](q2n3.png)



### Monitoring Tools

- **Query Plan Explainers**  
	- Shows the execution plan and estimated costs  
- **Performance Monitors**  
	- Tools that access the database internal counters and metrics  
- **Event Monitors**  
	- Record performance measures only when an event occurs


### Investigating High-Level Consumers

- Answer question 1  
	- Are critical queries being served in the most efficient manner?

1. **Identify the critical queries**  
	- Use Event Monitor to find end-of-statement with execution measures

![](evmon.png)

2. **Analyze the execution plan**  
	- Use Query Plan Explainer to analyze the relative cost of each operation

![](qpexpl.png)

In the execution plan, pay attention to:  
- Access methods  
	- sequential scan, index lookup, etc.  
- Sorts  
	- caused by ORDER BY, GROUP BY or DISTINCT  
- Intermediate results  
	- materialization to temporaries  
- Order of operations  
	- joins, sorts, aggregations, filtering  
- Algorithms used in operations  
	- types of join, etc.

3. Profile the execution
	- Use Performance Monitor to analyze duration and resource consumption

![](perfmon.png)

Duration involves 3 indicators:  
- Elapsed time  
	- The time it took to process the query as perceived by a user  
- CPU time  
	- The time that was actually used by the CPU to process the query  
- Wait time  
	- The time the query was waiting for a resources to become available

Two common scenarios  
- Elapsed time close to **CPU time**  
	- Probably difficult to optimize any further  
- Discrepancy between **elapsed time** and **CPU time**  
	- Points to a problem in resource consumption  
	- Possibly a contention problem or a poorly performing resource  
	- Run the query in isolation to investigate the cause

### Investigating Intermediate Resources/Consumers

- Answer question 2  
	- Are database subsystems making optimal use of resources?

1. **Disk subsystem**  
	- A table should be stored contiguously in a physical disk  
		- Avoid free space between records (**data fragmentation**)  
	- Table records should be stored in their correct order  
		- Avoid records out of place (**row displacement**)  
	- Periodic file reorganization may be necessary
	
![](storehier.png)

2. **Buffer manager**  
	- Two main performance indicators to monitor  
		- **Hit ratio** â€“ percentage of times that requested page is already in buffer  
		- Nu**mber of free pages** â€“ how much space is left in the buffer  
	- In SQL Server, these and other metrics can be obtained from system views 

![](buffman.png)

3. **Locking subsystem**  
	- Useful indicators  
		- Average lock wait time  
		- Number of locks on wait  
		- Number of deadlocks or timeouts  
	- SQL Server provides comprehensive wait statistics through system views

![](locklist.png)

4. Logging subsystem
	- Useful indicators  
		- Number of log waits â€“ ensure log can keep up with transactions  
		- Log expansions or log archives â€“ due to lack of space  
		- Log cache hit ratio â€“ analogous to buffer cache hit ratio  
	- Log waits > 0 means transactions are being held due to log writes


### Investigating Primary Resources

- Answer question 3  
	- Are there enough primary resources for the expected workload?

1. CPU  
	- Main indicator  
		- **Percentage of utilization**  
	- Use OS task manager to monitor CPU utilization  
	- Identify whether processes are database or non-database related  
	- Check CPU utilization of system (OS) processes in idle state

![](cpusuage.png)

2. Disks  
	- Main indicators  
		- Average size of the waiting queue  
		- Average time taken to service a request  
		- Bytes transferred per second  
	- Disk utilization can be monitored with OS utilities

![](disktr.png)

3. Memory
	- Some indicators  
		- Number of page faults/time  
		- Percentage of paging file in use  
	- Size of paging/swap file is an indication of how much memory is lacking
